# Form Plugin For WordPress
The goal of this experiment is to learn Gutenberg by exploring what it would take to replace something I already to -- a visual layout builder for a form plugin -- using Gutenberg. I should point out that _rewriting everything in React is not needed for integrating with Gutenberg_. In my actual plugin we're mianly using vanilla JS for our block and will either stay there or use VueJS or redo it kind of like in this experiement.

This is a total experiment. I'm learning to develop with Gutenberg so I thought about how I'd use it with a form builder, because that's what I do.

To be clear, this plugin not work and that's not the point.

## The Point Of This Plugin

The point of this plugin is to experiment with and discuss with others:
1) How to develop multiple blocks with one webpack config.
2) How to develop nested blocs.
3) How to architect a complex UI that uses Gutenberg for _some_ of its admin UI but will need to share components 

Also I needed to figure out how much React I need to know and want to use given that Gutenberg uses a React abstraction for DOM rendering, but I'm Team VueJS.
